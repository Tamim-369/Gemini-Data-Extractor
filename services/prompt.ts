Requirements:
1. Extract only: product name, price, and link
2. Format each product as JSON objects in this exact structure:
   [
     {
       "name": string,     // Max 300 characters
       "price": number,    // Numerical value only
       "link": string     // Set to null if URL is longer then 300 characters
     }
   ]

Rules:
- Return ONLY valid JSON data with no additional text/explanations

- Ensure all prices are numerical values
- Return an empty array [] if no valid products found
